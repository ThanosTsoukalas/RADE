# RADE Engine
A pretty simple Game/UI Engine made SDL using the `SDL_Video` library for rendering and other libraries.

# Building 
This project uses Makefile for building. You can build it wether you are on Windows, macOS or Linux (assuming you have SDL installed) by just running `mingw32-make` on Windows or just `make` on macOS and Linux.

# Get SDL
This project uses a very specific SDL Version, that is **2.28.5**. You can find how to install it on your system [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.28.5).
