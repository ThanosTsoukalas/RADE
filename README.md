# Rade Engine
A pretty simple Game/UI Engine made SDL using the `SDL_Video` library for rendering and other libraries.

# Building 
This project uses Makefile for building. You can build it wether you are on Windows, macOS or Linux (assuming you have SDL installed) by just running `mingw32-make` on Windows or just `make` on macOS and Linux.
